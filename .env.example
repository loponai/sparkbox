# --- MODULE VARIABLES ---
# Module-specific environment variables (passwords, secrets, etc.) are defined
# in each module's docker-compose.yml under x-sparkbox.env_vars and are
# automatically managed by the setup wizard.
#
# Run 'sparkbox install' to generate all required module variables,
# or enable modules via the dashboard — it handles configuration dynamically.
